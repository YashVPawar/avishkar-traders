            <h2>Tradition of Coal in Silver and Gold Business</h2>
            <p>Coal has played a crucial role in the silver and gold industries for centuries. It is traditionally used in smelting furnaces to provide the intense heat required for extracting and refining precious metals from ores, making it an essential component in metallurgical processes.</p>
            <p>Coal has long been used in traditional gold and silver smelting as both a fuel and a reducing agent. It helped generate the high temperatures needed to melt metal ores and played a key role in separating pure metals from impurities. Charcoal, a refined form of coal, was especially common in ancient furnaces and artisan workshops across India, Europe, and China. Its use was not only practical but often tied to ritual and craftsmanship passed down through generations.
